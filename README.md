# Blog-Generation-App-Using-Llama-2

This is a blog generation app. A quantized version of the Llama-2 model from the huggingface is used.<br />

The user can enter any topic of interest on which blog is to be generated. Additionaly number of words can also be entered. Along with this, user is able to choose his/her role (like 'Researchers', 'Engineers', 'Doctors', 'Content Creators', 'Sportsman', 'Businessman', 'Common People') so that the blog can be generated for the specific area. <br />

The model can be downloaded from the [Huggingface_Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)
